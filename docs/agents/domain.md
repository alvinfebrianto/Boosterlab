# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This is a single-context repo.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, if it exists.
- **`docs/adr/`** for ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in, if it exists.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.
